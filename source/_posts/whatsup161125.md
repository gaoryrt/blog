The reason why this article is written in English is that I'm using vim which is not chinese-display friendly.

The reason why I'm using vim is that vim is my only choice in a ssh.

And ssh is the easiest way I can imagine to connect to my computer's shell.

## so, what's up?
Well, people change, things go wrong, shit happens but life goes on.
I'm still working out every one or two days. I like this full-body-controll thingy.
No more youtube channel, no more WestWorld. The latest episode is unwatched.
Today, i got a money support because of my personal open-source project, this guy likes it.
And today, I saw my colleague forwarding an advertisment of job offer in his Wechat moments, and this job offer discribed what should I do for work.
My poor English can not discribe how I feel.

## um...
gather ye rosebuds while ye may
yesterday's still a flying
and same flower that smils today
tomorrow will be dying

that's all for these days
